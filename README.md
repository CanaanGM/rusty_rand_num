## Meant as an excersise to embark on my rustic journey ~!


### things i've learned doing this : 
1. every type in rust implements generic type methods like Parse
2. rust errors aren't Exceptional but are expected 
3. each method return a Result enum which has either a 
   1. Value which indecates sucess
   2. err which indecated failure
4. TOML is Tom's obvious markdown language xD
5. match is like a switch from python which matches an expresion or a value
6. creating a variable using *let* is like creating a *const* or a *readonly* variable
7. creating a variable and adding *mut* is like a normal *var* in python or a *read/write* in c#
